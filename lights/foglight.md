## Fog Light

A 1980 model car needs to have a foglight and will fail an MOT if it's not present & working. The standard car had a pair of fog lights dangling below the rear bumper. I don't particularly like them and wasn't keen on fitting, so I did something different. I figured the reversing lights weren't particularly good for lighting up the road behind so I sacrificed one of them to convert to a fog light.

The conversion was quite simple. I pulled out the reflector, drilled a hole in the back of the light unit & mounted an ultra-bright LED. These are marketed on eBay as "[Eagle Eye LED High Power 10w][]". They're quite cheap. I got 4 for \~Â£5.
