I purchased my MGB as a project from a local seller in 2018 as a bare shell on a rotisserie with lots of boxes of bits. The body shell was very solid and was almost ready to reassemble. There had been a lot of work done on it in the past using genuine panels, and there was very little rot still to fix. On the whole, the car was in very good condition and was ideal for my requirements. The car has now been fitted with a bigger, more modern V6 engine, with upgrades to the brakes and suspension. This will never be a concours show car and was never meant to be a faithful restoration. My aim is to build something that drives well, sounds nice, and is fun to drive.

    "content": "## Alternator This by far took me the most time to resolve satisfactorily. The Omega alternator is mounted on the left hand side of the engine looking at it from the front (drivers side). It's situated below the drivers side cylinder head. It wants to be in the same location as the chassis rail so clearly it has to be relocated. I thought long and hard about where to put it :- - Low and to the side of the engine - absolutely no room. - High and to the side of the engine - there isn't really room to put it on the drivers side thanks to the brake booster. It could go on the passenger side but I couldn't identify any convenient mounting points to locate it here. - In front of the engine - There's loads of space here. So, if I had to mount it in front of the engine, how would I mount it & plan the belt routing? I figured there's no way I could mount it in front of the engine the correct way around. There's simply nothing to bolt it to. However, I did find 3 bolt holes behind the cambelt cover that were used for engine mounts when the car was in front wheel drive orientation. This gave me the idea that I could create a bracket to reverse mount the alternator. I went through several bracket shapes & lots of consideration for belt path so I could get optimal wrap around all pulleys and still maintain tension. I then went to the breakers yard and found a small, powerful alternator with the correct bracket position and the correct pulley. The one I found was off a Ford. I didn't realise it at the time but it was a \"smart\" alternator that can vary its output according to the ECU but without the ECU, it runs as a 1-wire alternator outputting 90 amps. {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190420_155223.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190425_123945.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190430_195235.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190430_195245.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190430_195253.jpg %} ",

I've experimented with two set ups and here are my recommendations. ### Standard roll bar If you have a standard front anti-roll bar, the car benefits from retaining the rear anti-roll bar even if you've lowered the car to chrome bumper height. The rear bar makes the entire car feel more secure, predictable and modern. Without it, the car rolls far too much and seems vague & unpredictable on the road. ### Uprated roll bar An uprated 3/4\" front anti-roll bar gives you the stability you need to be confident in the car. You can remove the rear bar and still feel confidence that the car is behaving as you'd expect. You will get a little movement at the rear because now you've only got the springs locating the axle, but in exchange you get better grip and traction. The car seems to settle into corners better. I'd love to try this setup with a panhard rod. Of course, my engine location, weight, suspension, brakes and preferences are no doubt different to yours, so what works for me might not work for you. {% picture blog Arb-bushes.jpg %} ",

    "title": "MG RV8 Axle",
    "content": "## MG RV8 Axle While the original 3.9 axle ratio is tolerable with the Vauxhall 5-speed gearbox, it's not ideal. I'd often find myself pulling away in 2nd gear. I'd prefer the final drive ratio to be a bit taller. In pursuit of this, I won an auction on Ebay for an MG RV8 axle at a price that I could not refuse. Whilst this will fit an MGB, it's actually completely different to an MGB axle. It was used on a 1992-1995 MG RV8 which was based on an MGB. It's a Salisbury 12HA axle apparently sourced from a Leyland Sherpa. It has a 3.3 ratio and an OEM Quaife torque sensing limited slip differential (TORSEN LSD). There are a number of other differences as follows:- * It's slightly wider than an MGB steel wheel axle at approximately 52.5\" vs 51.5\". This won't cause an issue with wheel clearance on compression if the axle stays central however might cause minor rubbing of hard cornering. I was planning on fitting a panhard rod at some point anyway so perhaps this has moved up the agenda * The 4 cylinder MGB input flange is a Hardy Spicer 1140. The RV8 has a larger 1310 but has 10mm (M10) metric holes & bolts. These holes are slightly larger than the 3/8\" holes on the standard 1310 flange. Luckily my propshaft was built with 1310 UJs with an output flange for an 1140 so I'm able to swap this over for a standard 1310 output flange * The axle input flange to axle centre line distance is similar but not the same. An MGB is about 9.75\" (248mm) whilst the RV8 is slightly less at about 9.25\" (235mm). This places the input flange slightly further away from the propshaft. A standard 1310 yoke is 6.6mm shorter than my \"1310 with 1140 face\" yoke so with the axle fitted and the 1310 yoke fitted, my propshaft is ~20mm further away from the axle than it should be. A 20mm spacer will make up the difference * The wheel PCD is 4 x 4.5\" the same as the MGB however the studs are metric M12x1.5. Luckily, the MGB 1/2\"x20 studs can be persuaded to fit into the RV8 hubs without too much effort * The hubs have a hub-centric flange at 73mm for hub-centric wheels. The MGB hubs do not have hub-centric flanges but my LE alloy wheels do at 78mm so custom spigots are desirable * The way that the half-shafts fit into the axle tube is entirely different. The MGB has a separate hub that fits onto the end of the half shaft with a large nut to secure it. The RV8 has the hub permanently attached to the half shaft without the hub nut on the end. It reminds me more of the Ford cars that I've owned in the past. The bearing retainer is simply a circular disc that's bolted into threaded holes in the axle tube rather than bolting through with a nut on the back like the MGB. This would make a disc brake conversion somewhat more complicated * The handbrake mechanism for the drums is also very different. The RV8 axle has two separate cables that run all the way to the handbrake lever where they join via a small compensator. The interface between the cable and the handbrake uses a similar threaded bar, spring and adjusting nut as the MGB however it's a metric thread. An outer cable securing bracket will need to be added to the transmission tunnel. The RV8 one was too bulky so I made my own slimmer version * The flange for securing the axle to the springs is in the same place as on the MGB so it will bolt right up. However it's missing the fitting for the droop straps. The RV8 had telescopic shocks so I guess they were used for that purpose instead After fitting the axle, it became apparent that I have a few more challenges to address:- * Torque effects. My propshaft is quite a bit fatter than the RV8 propshaft. Space in the transmission tunnel is very limited and any excessive vertical movement of the axle will cause the propshaft to interfere. Now that I have more traction, the axle wants to twist more hence causing the nose of the diff to rise. To limit this, I've added some [torque control arms](/engineswap/torquecontrolarms/) to limit the rotation of the axle & hence the up/down movement of the propshaft. * Tyre rub. On hard cornering, if I also hit a bump, the tyre rubs on the wheel arch. This would suggest that the cause is lateral movement of the axle. A panhard rod would prevent this. {% picture PXL_20220516_091912149.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220516_181941861.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220517_083413466.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220516_100541216.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220516_100602067.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220516_114126812.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220516_114428073.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220516_181850391.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220516_181932566.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220517_144605876.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220528_160916089.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220617_180413439.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220619_135513233.jpg %} {% picture PXL_20220612_161924237.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220517_143507718.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220517_143446091.jpg %} ",

    "content": "## Brake Servo My brakes just didn't seem to work that well especially considering they're upgraded. I also noticed that my fuel injected, ecu driven engine was not idling perfectly, and I had an irritating surging from the engine at steady speed on light throttle. This all seemed to point at a leaky brake servo. This was confirmed by doing a few tests:- ### Test 1 With the engine off, pump the brake pedal a few times to push the brake pistons against the disk/drum. The pedal should now be hard. Start the engine, and feel the brake servo give braking assistance. The pedal should sink. In my case, the pedal only sank a little. Turn the engine off and the pedal should stay where it is for 30secs (at least) because the brake servo is holding a vacuum and hence continuing to provide assistance. In my case, it pushed back immediately. ### Test 2 Remove the vacuum line from the engine to servo and test that the one-way valves are working as expected. I have a hand operated vacuum pump with built in gauge to verify this, but you can do it just as easily by blowing through the valve. You should be able to pass air from servo side of the valve to inlet manifold but not vice-versa. ### Test 3 Make sure the engine is actually generating a vacuum at idle. Disconnect the vacuum pipe from the inlet manifold and test that you can hear it sucking in air. Do not put your finger over the end! ### Test 4 Use a vacuum pump & gauge to generate a vacuum into the servo & see if it holds. In my case, I was pumping like crazy and the vacuum bled down quicker than I could generate it. ### Conclusion After these tests, it was clear that my brake servo was not holding a vacuum even though my one-way valve was working and the engine was generating vacuum. I bought the cheapest new servo I could find on ebay. Even though it was supposedly for an MGB, I found that the 4 bolts that hold it to the pedal box were wrongly spaced. I had to drill out the holes to 10mm to give some additional clearance. I suspect that this servo had either been mistakenly made with metric spacing, or it was actually from another vehicle that happened to use the same master cylinder but used metric throughout. Either way, it works well once fitted. My brakes are now very good indeed! {% picture largethumb Brake-servo-testing.jpg %} {% picture largethumb New-servo.jpg %} ",

    "title": "Central Locking",
    "content": "## Central Locking There's not many modern features I miss on my MGB but central locking is one of them. Luckily, central locking kits are dirt cheap on ebay and are not hard to fit. There's a few components that need to be fitted in order for it to all work ### Door Solenoids The basic function of both the drivers and passenger door solenoids is to push or pull the locking mechanism to lock or unlock the door. To do this, they have 2 wires that take a positive and a ground (generally green & blue). The polarity of these wires is swapped depending on whether you want them to lock or unlock. These wires engergize a motor or a relay to cause a rod to be pushed or pulled. This rod is joined to the MGB lock operating rod using a clamp. The solenoids also have another 3 wires which allow a central locking relay to determine the current position of the solenoid (open or closed). The relay can then drive a second solenoid to mirror the action of the first. The solenoids are also designed so that they can be operated manually by turning the key in the lock {% picture blog solenoid.jpg %} #### Drivers Door The drivers door solenoid takes its input on green and blue wires from either the remote central locking ECU or from the alarm unit if that has a central locking function. This allows the solenoid to be energised to either lock or unlock based on a button press on a remote. However, the drivers door solenoid doesn't have to be electrically operated (even if these wires are connected). It can be manually operated from the key or from the locking lever inside the cabin. The drivers door solenoid has an additional 3 wires. One of these is connected to ground and the other is switched to ground depending on whether the door is locked or unlocked. These 3 wires are connected to the central locking relay and are used to drive the passenger door solenoid to mirror the drivers door solenoid. This allows the passenger door to mirror the state of the drivers door. | Wire | Function | --- |:---------------------------| blue & green | One of these pins should be positive and the other ground depending on lock or unlock. Leave disconnected for manual operation, or wired to the alarm or some other central locking controller for keyless entry| black | ground| white & brown | Connected to the central locking relay pins 2 & 3. One of these pins will be grounded depending on lock position| #### Passenger Door The passenger door solenoid has only 2 (functional) wires (blue and green). These are driven by the central locking relay and effectively mirror the state of the drivers door. For simplicities sake, we won't be attempting to allow the passenger door solenoid to operate the drivers door. | Wire | Function | --- |:---------------------------| blue & green | Connected to the central locking relay pins 1M and 2M| *Note, if your passenger solenoid has 5 wires, only use the blue & green* ### Central Locking Relay This 6-pin relay allows the passenger door solenoid to mirror the actions of the drivers door solenoid no matter how it's actuated. The way that it does this is to utilize the two output wires from the drivers solenoid to selectively ground either pin \"2\" or pin \"3\" on the relay which causes pin \"1M\" to be positive and \"2M\" to be negative, or vice-versa. These are connected to the blue & green wire on the passenger door solenoid. The relay has a short timer on it so that it will only fire for a second or so. | Pin | Function | --- |:---------------------------| + | Permanent Live| E (or ground symbol) | Ground | 2 & 3 | White & brown from the drivers door solenoid | 1M & 2M | Green & blue to the passenger door solenoid | *Note, experiment with orientation of pins 1M & 2M until correct operation of passenger lock is achieved* {% picture blog relay.jpg %} ### Mounting Location The solenoid must be positioned in a place where it can operate the locking mechanism but also where it won't be affected by the window winder mechanism. I found that the ideal place for is is just below the door locking mechanism. The operating rod should be shortened and bent into shape so it can operate the rod. The rods can then be joined by the supplied clamp. I suggest you use Locktight on the threads to prevent it from coming loose. {% picture blog solenoid-location.jpg %} {% picture blog PXL_20210313_122358872.jpg %} ### Wiring Diagram {% picture blog 8_central_locking.png %} ",

You could easily see and feel that the internal padding had broken down & was floating around. These parts are quite expensive to buy new so I thought it would be an easy job simply dismantle it and repair it. However, in reality I ended up completely rebuilding it because it was far beyond saving. Once dismantled, it was clear that the padding had completely perished and the plywood backing was rotten. So the first job was to make a new plywood backing piece. I made this from 2 sections of 3mm ply cut to shape and glued together whilst clamped to the dashboard until it was cured. The reason I did it this way is because the backing piece is curved in 2 dimensions & this is how you permanently set the shape that you need. Once this was done, I simply used the original part as a template to drill the holes and then moved over the original bolt fittings. {% picture blog IMG_20201130_173136.jpg %} The padding material was made of some kind of compacted fibre material which had broken into a dozen small pieces and in some areas completely disintegrated. There was no way of gluing it back together so an alternative needed to be made. I thought long and hard about what I could use in its place and in the end settled on some [half-round sponge rubber extrusion](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Half-Round-Sponge-D-Rubber-Extrusion-25mm-x-12-5mm-Cars-Boats-Home-DIY/113726337398) that I bought from ebay combined with some left-over 6mm closed cell foam. This was glued together using contact adhesive and bound with sticky tape whilst it cured. I then covered the entire thing with the same [black leather effect vinyl](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Bentley-Plain-Soft-FR-Vinyl-Smooth-Grain-Vehicle-Faux-Leather-Upholstery-Fabric/362618616938) that I used on the roof frame.

On the face of it, they're just common cylinder cam locks with a 90/90 governor and a custom cam on the back. The price probably reflects the design, development and testing that they've done to bring this to market, and for most MGB owners, it's a manageable one-off cost. However, I enjoy the challenge of making things like this myself, especially when it looks so simple. So, I trawled ebay, found a seller called **theonlinelockshop** who was selling high security radial cam locks with NAMA standard 19mm round, 16mm across the flats, 22mm head and 28mm length for just £8 each. The locks consist of 4 parts :- * The key * The barrel - this is a radial lock barrel, but you can get the same size lock with regular pin tumbler or disc mechanisms. Generally, you want one that's key retaining so the key can only be removed at the 12 o'clock position. * The governor - this is what prevents the lock from turning beyond its limits - we want a 90/90 governor so make sure the seller can supply. This allows us to turn the key 90 degrees in either direction. Left for lock, right for unlock. * The cam - this is the arm that sticks out the back Note, these locks are ''slightly'' larger than the standard locks so will need the smallest of adjusting to the hole to get them to fit. This is also true of the Moss locks. The cam that comes with the lock will generally be a straight arm which is entirely unsuitable, so a new cam will need to be made. The cam needs to have 2 arms on it. One arm needs to sit just below the locking lever when the key is at 12 o'clock and the car is unlocked, and the other needs to sit just above the locking arm when the key is at 12 o'clock and the car is locked. This is so that the arms can actuate the locking lever when you turn the key but still allow room for the arm to move when you lock/unlock from inside the car. {% picture blog IMG_20200715_133642.jpg %} {% picture blog PXL_20210313_122336147.jpg %} ",

    "content": "## EGR Delete The engine has an Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system which is very clever and misunderstood. In a nutshell, it's allowing inert gas to dilute your incoming air meaning that you need more throttle opening to burn the same amount of fuel. This is good because it's reducing pumping losses in the engine. In normal circumstances, I suggest you [*don't* remove because it's saving you money](http://www.tuneruniversity.com/blog/2012/05/dont-block-or-remove-the-egr-valve-its-saving-you-money/)! However in my case, I was making new tubular headers and I didn't want to incorporate the EGR system. Of course, it's not as simple as removing it because the ECU will helpfully tell you about it in the form of a check engine light, so we need to fool the ecu into thinking it's still there. Luckily this ECU is only measuring the return voltages of the EGR valve, so the answer is to build a circuit onto a piece of strip board that emulates this. You can use a pcb mount relay rather than an automotive relay to really reduce the size of the circuit.

It's a relatively common choice for good reason, but I like to be different so I considered other options The engine I chose is an odd choice at first glance and is one that no-one in the world had ever done before. I chose the 3.0 [GM 54° V6 X30XE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_54%C2%B0_V6_engine#3.0) from a UK Vauxhall Omega. It can be found in European Opel/Vauxhall Omega in rear wheel drive form or in Vectra, Cavalier and Calibra in front wheel drive form, and in the Saab 9000 as a turbo. It's also available in USA in the Opel Sintra, Cadillac Catera, CTS, Saturn L-series and Vue. It's a 200hp narrow angle V6 which suits our narrow engine bay. The engine is taller than most v6's but the profile of the inlet manifold is perfect for our bonnet shape. The 5 speed manual gearbox has ratios that are bearable on a standard MGB 3.9 rear axle although taller final drive is desirable. The starter motor is in the right place, the clutch is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that can be driven by the MGB master and a rear drop sump is available (from a front wheel drive variant). The ECU will run the engine standalone with very easy wiring. It's also similar weight to the standard 4 cylinder but puts out 208bhp. This swap choice was not something I'd initially considered but my friend had one in his garage and he urged me to take a closer look, and the more I looked, the more like it seemed the perfect choice! It does of course have a few challenges but far fewer than any other engine I'd considered. ",

It's occupying space that you need for the exhaust. Therefore, the mount needs to be slightly further forward. An engine mount always consists of 3 parts - the engine bracket, the rubber mount and the chassis bracket. The chassis bracket was moved to the rear part of the crossmember. There's plenty of room there to make a \\~30 degree platform for the engine mount to bolt on to. The rubber mount is a generic engine mount that I purchase from [Car Builder Solutions](https://www.carbuilder.com/). The engine side was templated in cardboard first and then cut from 5mm sheet steel, then carefully adjusted and trial-fitted until it was perfect. Remember to get both sides at exactly the same angle with engine aligned centrally. {% picture blog IMG_20190407_154551.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190404_212127.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190405_190903.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190405_190915.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190405_190947.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190405_190955.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190405_201014.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190407_154534.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190407_154543.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190407_155319.jpg %} ",

    "content": "## Exhaust Headers The Omega and Vectra/Cavalier/Calibra came with large cast iron exhaust headers that are entirely unsuitable for an MGB. New exhaust headers need to be made from scratch which might at first seem daunting but in actual fact was relatively straight forward but incredibly time consuming. You'll need to buy a pair of flanges, some stainless steel tube and various 90 degree bends (look for dairy pipe and weld elbows). These are easily available from several sellers on ebay. Once you have these, you'll notice that the exhaust outputs are oval shape whilst your pipe is round. You'll need to cut about 3 inches of pipe and then distort one end of it whilst not allowing the other end to distort. This is easier said than done especially with stainless steel but perseverance and brute force will prevail. Once you have the basic shape, you'll need to cut tack weld then into the header flange and cut them down as short as possible whilst still keeping the round end round. Now, with the engine & steering column in the car, you should attach some metal strip or wire to the engine such that it follows the shape of the steering column. This is so that you can remove the engine from the bay but you still have a reference with regard to available space. This means you can design & manufacture your exhaust header whilst the engine is out of the engine bay. As long as it fits within your reference guide, it will fit in the engine bay. The drivers side header will take a long time to get right. The passenger side one is simple in comparison. If you do it right, you will be able to route your exhaust inside the chassis rails so you won't have to chop any bodywork. I'm no expert at exhaust design, but there's no sharp bends and they look like they should flow gas relatively well. {% picture blog IMG_20190617_183808.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190514_183202.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190514_183428.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190514_184227.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190610_195756.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190610_202609.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190610_202614.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190617_183820.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190617_184114.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190617_184246.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190617_184254.jpg %} ",

This was actually made in UK by Bell Steel](https://www.bell-steel.co.uk/). I chose to fit the chrome bumper version even though my car is rubber bumper with a chrome conversion. I figured if the suspension was going to be chrome bumper height, then I wanted to keep as much ground clearance as possible. This logic did work ok to an extent, but I didn't realize that the bends in the chrome bumper exhaust would interfere with the rubber bumper handbrake mechanism. This meant I also had to fit a chrome bumper handbrake cable & compensator. The exhaust fitted remarkably well. The V8 splitter pipe was very close to my exhaust header outlets & it wasn't too much trouble to make it fit. However, at some point, I'd like to get this part of the exhaust professionally made because the tube is one size too small and hangs slightly too low. I also made a small amendment to the rear section. Out of the box, the bend where the exhaust pitches upwards from the under-axle section to the rear box was a little too far forward for my liking. The handbrake cable touched at full droop. It also put the end of the tail pipe just under the rear bumper which contributed towards noise in the cabin. I purchased a pre-flared and slotted 2.25\" x 6\" stainless steel repair section from ebay & used it to extend the rear section by approx 3\". This gave me far more clearance to the handbrake cable and quietened the exhaust noise in the cabin noticeably. {% picture largethumb IMG_20191212_193138.jpg %} {% picture largethumb Bsmgbv8cbpic1_2.jpg %} ",

That means the engine cranks for just a little longer than I'd like. I'd much prefer the pump to prime the fuel rail before I crank. The fix is to install a momentary relay to give the fuel pump power when you turn ignition on. Believe it or not, such a relay is harder to find than you might think. However, [Car Builder Solutions sell a 0-60 second timer relay](https://www.carbuilder.com/uk/0-to-60-second-time-delay-relay-for-demist) which will engage for a short time when it's given power. This means we can use it to supply power to the fuel pump for 3-5 seconds when we first turn on the ignition.

    "title": "Fuel Tank",
    "content": "## Fuel Tank The fuel tank in an MGB sits below the boot floor and is quite shallow. It's designed to feed carburettors via a low pressure fuel pump (SU). The tank is not baffled but that's not a big deal with carbs because the float chamber will buffer a small amount of fuel. However, this fuel system is entirely unsuitable for a fuel injected engine. The X30XE needs a high pressure fuel pump. The fuel rail runs at 3.0 bar (or 3.8 bar with an updated pressure regulator). The standard X30XE fuel pump supplies 108 litres per hour (lph). In addition, you'll need an additional fuel line so unused fuel can return to the fuel tank. There's 2 ways to make the MGB fuel system suitable for a fuel injected engine. The first way is to use the low pressure pump to lift fuel from the main tank into a small auxiliary tank. This auxiliary tank will contain a high pressure fuel pump which can be used to feed the engine. This has the advantage of not requiring any fuel tank mods and of being less susceptible to fuel starvation but the disadvantage is a much more expensive and complicated setup. The other way is to mount the high pressure pump directly in the tank. The advantage is that it's massively cheaper and simpler, but does need you to modify your tank. You also have to make sure that the fuel pickup is not starved of fuel when you accelerate or go around a corner because most MGB tanks are not baffled. There's plenty of ways to tackle this problem. You could [install an EFI ready tank][] or [modify your own tank][] to make it EFI ready. I chose to modify my own but I did it slightly differently. My solution was to use an Impreza WRX fuel pump. These are capable of running at about 180-220lph and provide plenty of pressure. They are also real cheap on eBay (£20-30). The disadvantage is that they don't have a built-in swirl pot. In order to fit the fuel pump, I needed to make a few mods to the pump mechanism :- 1. Remove the Subaru fuel level sensor. Stick with the existing MGB one. 2. The metal mounting arm is too long, so needs shortening. 3. The thinnest pipe needs cutting short inside the tank so we can use it as a vent. If you don't do this, it risks sitting below the fuel level & then if there's a positive pressure difference inside the tank, it will push fuel out through this hose. Don't ask me how I know this :) 4. An oval hole needs cutting in top of the tank. I chose to put mine in the flat area where the spare wheel boss is. You can use the rubber seal to show you how large the hole needs to be. Be careful to use tools that do not give a spark. I used a drill on a very slow speed to start a hole, then tin snips to finish it. 5. I made an oval shaped collar with captive nuts that sits inside the hole, held in place by a few pop rivets. This lets me bolt through the fuel pump flange, through the fuel tank skin & engage in the captive nuts to firmly hold the fuel pump in place against the rubber seal 6. Cut a hole in the boot floor to accommodate. Make sure to identify the feed and return before you mount the pump into the tank so you can plumb them in appropriately. Make sure to pass the feed through a fuel filter to protect your injectors. The MGB standard vented fuel filler cap allows venting in the outward direction only so any over-pressure in the tank will vent. It does not allow fresh air into the tank to replace the fuel that the engine consumes. I have no idea how this ever worked when the car was running carbs. This means you should utilise the vent pipe in the Subaru fuel pump. DO NOT block it off as shown in my pics below. At the very least, pass it through a 1-way valve and vent to atmosphere so the tank can suck air in as necessary. I've taken a slightly different approach and mounted an MX5 carbon canister where the passenger side battery would mount if this were an older car with 2 batteries. For now, I've connected the tank vent line to the canister and in future, will connect the canister to the purge valve on the engine. Another thing to consider is that the MGB tank is not baffled so you'll get fuel starvation with anything less than 1/3rd of a tank, so the solution is to make the largest baffle / swirl pot that can get through the hole and attach it to the bottom of the fuel pump. With this solution, I can run with the needle pointing to the white line at the bottom of the fuel gauge. I estimate this is \\~4 litres in the tank. Of course, now that you have a fuel pump, you still need to send the fuel to the front of the car. To do this, I used two lengths of 8mm copper gas pipe that I bought from my local hardware supplier. It was bent to shape with a cheap pipe bending tool from eBay. {% picture mediumthumb fuelpump.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190806_211722.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190806_211732.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190806_190911.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190806_200738.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190806_200755.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190806_211755.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190819_182638.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20200910_174003.jpg %} [install an EFI ready tank]: http://www.britishv8.org/Articles/Aluminum-EFI-Ready-MGB-Fuel-Tank.htm [modify your own tank]: http://www.britishv8.org/Articles/EFI-Fuel-Tank-Mods.htm ",

The final gear ratios are not too far different from the donor car however, with the MGB being so much lighter, a higher gearing is desirable.

This is bulky and gets in the way. The gearbox has an internal lockout anyway so it's not required. I suspect they only fitted it to standardize their range of cars.

I didn't have one of these boards when I got my car, probably because it had a sunroof and therefore wouldn't fit. However, these boards are usually perished anyway so I'd either [need to make a new one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cOsY9SgdE) or do it differently. I chose the latter option. I decided to stick the headlining direct to the outer skin. This is the least effort option which I hope will be successful in the long run. To do this, I bought some [6mm sticky backed closed cell foam from ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/3M-6mm-Car-Sound-Proofing-Deadening-Camper-Van-Insulation-Closed-Cell-Foam-Sheet/184106555361) and some [black 2mm foam backed headlining material](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Car-Headlining-or-Headliner-Fabric-2mm-Foam-Backed-By-the-metre-140cm-wide/302234082544) from ebay. Fitting was easy for me because I was in the process of fitting a new steel roof skin so I had the luxury of fitting the headlining whilst it was off the car. All I had to do was to make sure the foam was cut to shape larger than the visible area & then carefully stuck into place. I then cut a similar sized piece of headlining material & glued that directly onto the foam using spray contact adhesive. The resulting thickness is enough to take up the gap between the roof and the frame and results in a rather neat job. I finished the job by replacing the old vinyl that covered the frame beneath the headlining with new [black leather-effect vinyl](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Bentley-Plain-Soft-FR-Vinyl-Smooth-Grain-Vehicle-Faux-Leather-Upholstery-Fabric/362618616938).

When I purchased mine, I didn't have the transponder ring so I had to reprogram the ECU so that it didn't expect to talk to the immobilizer. This worked fine but it left me with a car with less security so I purchased another ECU, immobilizer and transponder chip from ebay for £50. Fitting the transponder ring in the steering column shroud is quite straight forward but you'll need to cut the shroud a little. Luckily it fits around the MGB key barrel reasonably well. Once you've physically fitted it, you need to wire it in. My transponder came without the wiring loom so I was missing the plug. The pin spacing is a standard 2.54mm. A quick search of eBay turned up a [JST-XH 2.54mm 9pin connector](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=JST-XH+2.54mm+9pin). This fitted into the socket quite tightly.

The easiest way to do this is to get a Landrover Discovery key blank. This has the same key blade as the MGB & has a space for the transponder chip to be inserted. [^1]: I believe the ECU will use this signal to decide when to initiate fuel cut on deceleration. My car pops & bangs on deceleration and idle will dip slightly before settling when I come to a stop. I think connecting this pin will cure the problem but the speed signal needs to be correct for the ECU. My current speed sensor is not outputting the correct speed signal. That's something I intend to fix. {% picture largethumb IMG_20200129_185223.jpg %} {% picture largethumb Key.png %} ",

This, in association with the inlet plenum, is part of the [variable length tuned intake system][] designed to enhance torque output. It's described in detail in the [Vauxhall College manual][]. The problem is, the entire Omega Multiram is physically too large to fit and also is designed to fit a drivers side mounted air filter. I don't have room for that in the MGB so an alternative inlet is necessary. I considered omitting the Multiram completely but this didn't necessarily solve any problems. I still needed to use the Omega rubber elbows that fitted onto the twin throttle bodies. Quite simply, I couldn't replace them with rubber tube because they were so close together and I couldn't locate any suitable tube that would fit. That left me with the situation that I needed to merge two 60mm pipes together into a single 80mm pipe so it could enter a common [air flow meter][]. I tried various different solutions but the one that fitted the best was made from 76mm PVC pipe and looked conceptually similar to the standard Opel Omega part. It also allowed me to retain the multiram valve mechanism. To complete the solution, I mounted an air filter behind the front grill and connected the two with flexible air ducting. {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20200123_191048.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20200123_191107.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20200123_191135.jpg %} [multiram]: http://www.omegaowners.com/forum/index.php?topic=90513.0 [variable length tuned intake system]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_intake_manifold [Vauxhall College manual]: http://calibra-classic.org/docs/vaux_v6_engine.pdf [air flow meter]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_flow_meter ",

They are one of the best places to get a custom prop manufactured in UK, and they were also one of the few places who could supply a prop with the correct flanges to bolt direct to the gearbox without an adapter. The complete specifications for the prop are shown below... - 1 piece propshaft with 3 bolt gearbox flange, appropriate slider, 4 bolt rear flange with 1140 face, with 1310 UJ's.

However, it *just* misses when the axle is at full droop. The extra length, however, did provide some frustration when fitting. It's simply too long to fit after the engine & gearbox is in place! *Note, even though the MGB diff has a flange for an 1140 UJ, Dave Mac Props used a special variant of the 1310 UJ on my prop which benefits from the larger physical size of the 1310 but will bolt to a smaller 1140 flange* {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20191104_180210.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20191105_192849.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20191105_192908.jpg %} [Dave Mac Propshafts Ltd]: https://davemacprops.co.uk/ ",

    "content": "## Rear Disc Brakes When I first MOTed after the rebuild, I had problems with rear brake imbalance. My brand new rear brake cylinders had leaked and polluted the new brake shoes. I fixed the problem, but I learnt to hate drum brakes and resolved to swap to disc brakes as soon as was practical. You can buy off-the-shelf kits quite easily but they are horrendously expensive. I thought I could make my own conversion on a budget To swap to discs, you need 3 main components. The disc itself, the brake caliper and the bracket to bolt the caliper to the axle. ### The Disc The trick for a successful conversion is to find a disc that has the same bolt pattern, is small enough to fit inside the 14\" wheel, has the correct offset so that the caliper will fit behind the wheel and provides approximately the same level of braking effort as the drums. Research of the ATE brake catalog showed that there were 3 main candidates that would possibly work :- #### Volvo These discs will bolt on without modification but are too shallow so caliper clearance is an issue for factory wheels. They may be ok if you're running larger aftermarket wheels. #### Hyundai/Kia These discs will also bolt on without modification and are very deep so there would be no caliper clearance problems. However, they are designed with a built-in drum for the handbrake mechanism (which we wouldn't use) so the disc braking surface is rather slim. The brake pads for my chosen caliper overlap the edge of these discs so they're clearly not a viable option. #### Honda These discs are not a direct bolt on fit but are in all other respects the perfect choice. The depth of the braking surface is deeper than the Volvo disc but not as deep as the Kia disc, but they're deep enough for the caliper to snugly fit behind my 14\" LE alloy wheel and the braking surface area is just right for the pads of my chosen caliper. However, the centre bore needs enlarging to 3\" with a hole saw. This is easier than it sounds because the metal is relatively soft. You'll need to create a jig so that you drill it centrally, but is quite achievable with a hand drill. If you want to, you can also drill two countersunk holes for the grub screws. The Borg & Beck part number of this disc is BBD5071 and is used on the 1996-1998 Honda Accord and 1993-1999 Rover 600. {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20210409_175457481.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20210412_163727124.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20210412_163741323.MP.jpg %} ### The Brake Caliper There's several candidates for the brake caliper. The guys in USA tend to use Nissan parts (Sentra 34mm piston or 200sx 38mm piston). However, in Europe, the Lucas caliper for an MG-F or MG-TF (38mm piston) is a better choice. The caliper handbrake mechanism is also a better layout for this conversion because they pull inwards in the same direction as the drum brakes rather than towards the front of the car. *Warning. My brake pads came with anti-squeal shims attached however they prevent the outer pads from contacting the disc squarely. Make sure to remove them!* {% picture blog PXL_20210412_164001047.jpg %} ### The Mounting Bracket The mounting bracket is a custom part. You'll need to make these yourself or get someone to make them for you. These should be made in 2 parts - the bracket to locate the caliper relative to the axle and a 6mm thick spacer to locate the depth of the caliper relative to the disc. I welded these two parts together to improve strength of the part as a whole. Apart from the obvious welds, I also welded these along the edges by grinding an angle and welding inside the resulting vee. If you do this, be careful of heat distortion. {% picture largethumb PXL_20210417_135649460.jpg %} {% picture largethumb PXL_20210417_135641966.jpg %} ### The Brake Hoses Now that you've got the discs fitted and got the calipers mounted to the axle, you'll need to plumb them in. Your brake drums only needed hard lines to connect to the brake slave cylinder but your new calipers are sliding calipers so they'll move during normal operation. This means that you'll need flexible brake hoses. You'll need to get these made or make them yourself using a self-build brake kit. {% picture blog PXL_20210518_180357478.jpg %} ### Handbrake Cable The handbrake mechanism on these Lucas calipers pulls inwards much like the drums do on an MGB. The ends of the standard MGB brake cable attach to the calipers in much the same way. You can use the standard cable and compensator but the cables need shortening by about 1.5-2\". It's possible that a wire-wheel cable will be the correct length if used on a steel wheel car. If you shorten the cables, it's important that you clamp or crimp the ends securely so that the cable doesn't slip. You'll also find that the handbrake lever ratio is not quite enough to pull the handbrake 100%. No amount of adjustment will change this. To fix this, you'll need to remove the handbrake lever and remove the lower part where the adjuster attaches. This will then need extending by approx 10mm. This will cause the cable to be pulled further for a given amount of handbrake application. Mine now fully engages after about 6 clicks. ",

I think that would have resulted in injury! It had to go! I decided early on that I would not be trying to use a 2nd hand roof. New ones are not cheap but in the grand scheme of things, are not that expensive either so I decided to suck it up. Removing the old roof was quite straightforward. The spot welds could be drilled out along the front and rear flanges but the side of the roof had been spot welded in an overlapping fashion deep inside the gutters. This meant I had to grind away until the metal was thin enough to prise away without damaging the framework underneath. It was time consuming but straight forward to achieve. Once the old roof was off, the new one was trial fitted. It fitted perfectly as you'd expect from a genuine part. Final fitment was done with a modern automotive 2-part epoxy glue designed for fitting roofs to cars.

However, no matter how cool it looks, it's too low. I struggle with speed humps, I get noticable bump steer and occasionally ground out on bumpy roads. The car was ~13.5\" from centre of the wheel to the bottom of the chrome strip. The suspension and steering arms were noticably angled upwards I wanted to raise this to almost an inch to bring the suspension geometry closer to where it should be so I figured I would to try some longer springs. The ratio of spring length difference to height difference is approx 2:1, so an additional 1/2\" height in spring will cause the car to be 1\" taller given the same wire diameter and spring rate. This means I'd need springs about 9.3\" long which happens to be exactly the length of the spare BHH1077 springs that I had. However, when I put these in the car, the ride height was about 17.5\"!! This would obviously settle over time but a week and about 100 miles had it settle just 1/4\" and I wasn't convinced it would settle another 3\"! I needed another plan. I could either randomly try other springs according to the table below or I could work with the ones I have. Randomly trying new stuff takes time to yield results & gets expensive real fast so I decided to do the latter, at least temporarily. I cut some nylon plastic rings from a kitchen chopping board (6mm thick) and added one to the bottom spring cup and one to the top. This gave me a total length of 9.27\" which is just 0.1\" shorter than the BHH1077 springs. The car is now running almost 14.5\" ride height which is exactly the height I was after. I can't explain why the BHH1077 springs made the ride height so tall. I do plan to try some alternatives at some point, but for now the car is running well with the spacers. Was it worth it? Well, The suspension geometry is now only slightly compromised and the ride quality has significantly improved. I no longer have bad bump steer and I don't ground out on bumpy roads.

Of course, you now need a speedo that can understand the signals from the speed sensor. You have two options. One is to buy an adapter box that takes its input from a speed sensor and converts to a mechanical output so that you can drive the standard speedo. These are [available from USA](https://www.speedhut.com/Speedbox.html) but are very expensive (\\~$300 + shipping, VAT and import duty). The second is to replace the speedo with a unit that takes an electronic input natively. I was baulking at the cost of either an adapter box or a Smiths digital speedo and was looking for alternatives. I found an untested 80mm Siemens VDO electronic speedo for £10. \"Untested\" usually means it's broken but I thought I'd take a chance for £10. When I received it, I powered it up and tested it using the test procedure explained below, and it seemed to work. I mounted it in the dashboard using the original Smiths mounting legs and attached the original Smiths trim ring to the front using Sikaflex. I then followed the instructions [Siemens VDO user manual][] to calibrate it and now it's working great. It doesn't even look too out of place. It did, however, have blown backlight bulbs. These should be 1.2W T10 wedge bulbs. These bulbs are only commonly available in 5W variants at your local motor factor but I don't think having 10W of backlight would be particularly healthy. You can get the proper 1.2W bulbs cheaply but you need to search for \"[T10 fruit machine bulbs][]\" on ebay. You can bulk buy 50 of them cheaper than buying a single bulb at your motor factors. You should probably buy green variants of these bulbs so that your speedo matches the other gauges on the dashboard My cheap speedo also had an intermittent dim/non-functional odometer. You can buy these [brand new on Aliexpress][] for not a lot of money. Fitting is straightforward but you do need to completely dismantle the speedo to fit it. {% picture blog IMG_20200806_152131.jpg %} ### Pulses per mile One of the things I needed to calculate was the pulses per mile (ppm) so I could configure the speedo. Here's the math... - Tyre size 185/70/14 = 835 revolutions per mile - - Diff ratio is 3.07, so one revolution of the wheel is 3.07 revolutions of the propshaft - 835 x 3.07 = 2563 prop revolutions per mile - - I have 3 pulses per revolution of the propshaft - 2563 x 3 = 7690 pulses per mile ### Testing An Electronic Speedo Testing a electronic speedo is easier than it sounds. One simply has to take the pulses-per-mile figure that we worked out above. At 60mph, we'll achieve this number of pulses in 1 minute so if we divide by 60 we get the number of pulses per second. In my case, approx 128 pulses per second. If we replay this into the speedo, we should see it read 60mph provided it's configured properly. But, how do we replay 128 pulses per second into the speedo? The easiest way is to read that number as cycles per second aka hertz. We can then use an [online tone generator][] to create an audible tone which we can feed into the speedo via the headphone jack. One wire from the headphone jack should go to the signal input and the other to ground. Once you see indicated 60mph, you can halve the frequency for 30mph to check the linearity of the speedo.

    "content": "## Speed Sensor The Vauxhall Omega gearbox does not have any speedo output at all, neither mechanical nor electronic. On the donor car, the speed signal was taken from the ABS sensors. However, the MGB does not have ABS sensors so a workaround is needed in order to generate that speed signal. The speed signal should be used for 2 things :- * To feed the VDO speedometer * To feed the ECU via the Immobilizer. The purpose of this signal (I believe) is simply to tell the ECU when the car is moving so it can cut fuel on overrun to stop those pops and bangs and also to enrich fuel when the car comes to a sudden stop to prevent the idle dipping. The car will still run without this signal. Currently, I have a 3-wire hall effect speed sensor mounted on the gearbox close to the output flange so that it triggers for each leg of the 3 bolt flange as the prop rotates. The speed signal output feeds the VDO speedometer directly but it's not compatible with the ECU. The speed signal also breaks down a little when the speed increases which results in some needle instability at speed. You could argue that this adds an little authenticity. My next plan is to use a [universal traction control wheel](http://trigger-wheels.com/store/contents/en-uk/p155.html) bolted to the prop flange along with a Vauxhall ABS sensor and a Vauxhall speed control relay to improve the action of the speed sensing circuit. This will be fed into pin 6 of the immobilizer. The speedo can be driven in parallel. {% picture blog IMG_20200417_192411.jpg %} ",

The new alternator wire is a heavy gauge wire that goes directly from the alternator to the starter motor. The alternator that I've fitted is a 1-wire unit which means that the charge light does not work anymore.

It would foul the cross member in every way possible. A rear-drop sump was required! Luckily the front wheel drive variants of this engine (Vectra, Cavalier or Calibra) come with a sump that's rear-drop when installed in a RWD configuration. So the first job to do on the engine is to remove the Omega sump and oil pickup pipe and install pickup and sump from a Vauxhall Vectra. When fitting the oil pickup pipe, make sure to use Loctite on the mounting bolts. You don't want this thing falling off! Make sure to be very careful about using the correct torque for the bolts too. When fitting the sump make sure to use the correct high temperature silicone sealant and a new sump gasket. Once again be meticulous about correct torque. Note, The sump bolts are really not done up very tight at all, so don't overtighten. {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190302_123315.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190302_123323.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190316_180534.jpg %} ",

    "content": "## Tachometer The standard MGB rev counter will not work directly with the tachometer output signal from the ECU for 2 reasons :- the signal is too weak, and it's pulsing for 6 cylinders and not 4. In order to make it work, we need to either replace the rev counter with one that will accept the ECU signal, or adapt the one we have. I like the original Smiths gauge so I chose the latter option. The adapter box can be purchased quite cheaply from [Spiyda][]. He sells two versions :- one for the RVI tacho which will fit inside the casing, and one for all other tacho (including RVC) which is an external unit. I have an RVC tacho so I chose the latter. The adapter will take a tacho output from more or less any source, including an ECU, for any number of cylinders, and drive more or less any tacho. It's truly a universal translator for tachometer signals. Fitting it is relatively straight forward. The Spiyda adapter needs to drive the tacho movement directly, so you basically need to dismantle the Smiths tacho and isolate the internal circuitry, then connect the movement directly to the pins on the back of the rev counter. You can then wire the Spiyda adapter to the rev counter pins and the ECU tacho output into the Spiyda adapter. I'm not going to explain exactly how to do this because [Spiyda's instructions][] are very comprehensive. There is, however, one thing you need to do inside the tacho that Spiyda doesn't mention. When connecting the internal movement to the 2 pins, one of the wires (either) needs a 200 Ohm resistor wired in series. Both pins also need a 100 Ohm resistor wired across them. This is because the RVC rev counter is too sensitive. The resistors desensitise it slightly. Once it's all physically wired, you can [calibrate it][] using Spiyda's calibration audio tracks. The audio tracks are pure sine waves with a frequency matching that which you would get at certain RPM. This means when you play the audio track into the adapter, it will show the correct RPM on the tacho. You can then adjust the adapter via the trim pot to make the tacho read correctly. e.g. if you play the 200hz audio track, that should show 4000rpm for a 6 cylinder engine. I'd suggest trying several tracks and checking the linearity of the adapter. Note, my laptop worked fine playing the audio tracks, but my Android phone wouldn't. You can also verify the rev counter by running OpCom software on your laptop & accessing the realtime diagnostics. {% picture largethumb External_2.jpg %} [Spiyda]: https://www.spiyda.com/smiths-rvi-rvc-conversion-external.html [Spiyda's instructions]: https://www.spiyda.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/pdf/TACHO%20EXTERNAL%20MK3.pdf [calibrate it]: https://www.spiyda.com/tacho-calibration-information ",

One way I could do that was to install a high level third brake light. I wasn't happy with any of the universal kits that I found. I wanted something that looked like it should be there. Specifically, I wanted something with a housing designed for the MGB rear screen. Obviously, no such thing existed so I would need to find something very close. After much research, I found a unit from a VW Passat B6. The shape of the housing is ideal for an MGB. It mounts to the glass with a pair of small alloy brackets that are glued on. The housing then slides onto these brackets. Half of the housing is visible through the glass and the other half overhangs the screen rubber and frame. It's very slim and unobtrusive. Wiring is simple with just 2 wires - one to ground and one to the brake light. {% picture blog PXL_20210317_180114106.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20210318_174051523.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20210318_174044916.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20210318_174444067.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20210318_174422111.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20210318_174303059.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20210318_174250534.jpg %} ",

    "content": "## Torque Control Arms After fitting my RV8 axle with Quaife LSD, it became apparent that the extra grip was causing torque effects on the axle, causing the nose of the axle to rise & the propshaft to interfere with the handbrake bracket in the transmission tunnel. MG fitted lower torque control arms on the RV8 to counter this effect so I'd need to do something similar. I had two approaches that I could take:- 1) Follow the RV8 model of mounting anti-tramp bars below the springs. This prevents the lower part of the axle from twisting forwards hence stops the axle from rotating. However to fit this, I'd need a sturdy way to mount the forward anti-tramp pivot below the forward spring pivot. MG achieved this using an additional box section welded to the floor of the car. This is a great solution but would be a big job to do at this stage of my cars evolution. Other options exist using smaller brackets or using the \"Cal-trac\" method, neither of which seem particularly satisfactory. 2) Mount the torque control arms above the axle. These would prevent axle rotation by preventing the top of the axle twisting towards the rear of the car. Ford used this method on the Escort. My MG is a later model so I already have sturdy body attachments where the anti-roll bar was fitted but I don't have attachments on the axle. Strictly speaking, this method would not prevent spring wind-up and hence isn't a true anti-tramp device, but would prevent most axle rotation problems. So, given the above facts, I went with option #2 for now. Choosing this option does not exclude me from adding option #1 at some point in future as well. The arms themselves are made from sections of the rear anti-roll bar extended with 20mm tube. I used the original ARB mount at one end and a custom made rubber mount at the other. I originally used a Rose joint but this was very noisy. They make a positive improvement to the driving experience. The car feels nicer to pull of in first gear and gear changes seem more positive. I attribute this to less axle rotation when torque is introduced and hence more rotation making it to the wheels. So far, it's also cured my problem of excessive propshaft movement. {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220617_180413439.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb PXL_20220619_135513233.jpg %} ",

I chose to do the mod slightly differently to how Rover did theirs. My method was less crude. I effectively reshaped the horizontal seam where the transmission tunnel meets the bulkhead & reattached it in exactly the same way but as a curved joint rather than a straight joint. I gained about 10-15mm of clearance & it still looks factory. {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190311_203448.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190628_191847.jpg %} {% picture mediumthumb IMG_20190630_200032.jpg %} ",
