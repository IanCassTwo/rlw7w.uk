## Front Brakes

The front brakes consist of MGB GT V8 discs which are the same size as
regular MGB brakes but much thicker (12mm). The brake calipers are brand
new ["Princess" 4-pot calipers][] mounted using [Triumph GT6 metric
caliper bolts (p/n 158713)][] and Land Rover brake hoses. This is a
[tried and trusted brake upgrade][] which should provide much more
stopping power than standard.
