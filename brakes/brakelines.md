## Brake Lines

Brand new cunifer brake lines were fitted throughout the car with proper brake unions made on a [very good quality universal flaring tool](https://automec.co.uk/products/universal-flaring-tool). Pipes were routed in the same way as standard except the front brake lines go through the inner wing via a rubber grommet rather than under the chassis rail. All rubber flexible hoses were also replaced.
