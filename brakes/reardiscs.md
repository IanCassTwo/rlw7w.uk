## Rear Disc Brakes

When I first had my car MOTed after the rebuild, I had problems with the rear drum brakes. I ended up replacing my new drums, shoes and cylinders with yet another new set to solve the problem. I learnt to hate drum brakes and resolved to swap to disc brakes as soon as was practical.

**WARNING: This project is ongoing. Some of this information might change after I get it finalized**

To swap to discs, you need 3 main components. The disc itself, the brake caliper and the bracket to bolt the caliper to the axle.

### The Disc
The trick for a successful conversion is to find a disc that has the same bolt pattern, is small enough to fit inside the 14" wheel and has the correct offset so that the caliper will fit behind the wheel. Research of the ATE brake catalog showed that there were 3 main candidates that would possible fit the criteria

#### Volvo
Too shallow but would be ok on aftermarket wheels. It's a direct bolt on fit. However, the bracket would need quite a deep spacer to place the caliper in the correct position. This might expose the bracket to more leverage forces than necessary.

#### Hyundai/Kia
Very deep disc so no problems with caliper fit. However, its designed with a built-in drum for handbrake mechanism (which we wouldn't use) so the disc braking surface is rather slim. Brake pads for my chosen caliper overlapped the edge of the disc. It's a direct bolt on fit. The bracket would need the spacer between the bracket and the axle to move the caliper away from the disc.

#### Honda
Depth of braking surface is somewhere in between the Volvo and Kia disc, but it's deep enough for the caliper to comfortably fit behind my 14" LE alloy wheel. The braking surface area is just right for the pads of my chosen caliper. However, the centre bore is not large enough to fit over the axle stub. It needs boring out to 3" with a hole saw. This is easier than it sounds because the metal is relatively soft. You'll need to create a jig so that you drill it centrally, but should be quite achievable with a hand drill. If you want to, you can also drill two countersunk holes for the grub screws. The bracket needs a 6mm spacer to place the caliper closer to the disc.

The Borg & Beck part number of this disc is BBD5071 and is designed for a 1996-1998 Honda Accord.

### The Brake Caliper
There's several candidates for a brake caliper. The guys in USA tend to use Nissan parts (Sentra 34mm piston, 240sx 38mm piston). However, I think that the MG-F or MG-TF caliper (38mm piston)  is a better choice in the UK. The caliper handbrake mechanism is a better layout for this conversion. The pads are an ideal size for the Honda disc.

### The Bracket
The bracket is a custom part. You'll need to make these yourself or get someone to make them for you. These should be made in 2 parts - the bracket to locate the caliper in relation to the axle and a 6mm thick spacer to locate the caliper in relation to the disc. I welded the two parts together to improve strength of the part as a whole.

### The Brake Hoses
Now that you've got the discs fitted and got the calipers mounted to the axle, you'll need to plumb them in. Your brake drums only needed hard lines to connect the brake slave cylinder but your new calipers are sliding calipers so they'll move during normal operation. This means that you'll need flexible brake hoses. You'll need to get these made or make them yourself using a self-build brake kit.
