## Starting and Charging

There's 2 high amperage wires that connect the alternator output to the starter motor. I've unwrapped these wires from the main engine bay loom and re-routed them from starter motor through the bulkhead to the area beneath the dashboard on the drivers side. I've mounted a new fuse box here and I'm using these to feed 2 permanent live circuits. These circuits are used for the engine ECU and fuel pump circuits.

The new alternator wire is a heavy gauge wire that goes directly from the alternator to the starter motor.

The alternator that I've fitted is a 1-wire unit which means that the charge light does not work anymore. I've replaced it with an [intelligent red LED light](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/12V-Universal-fit-RED-LED-Alternator-Battery-Warning-Light-Charge-status-monitor/323749517837) that flashes when battery level is too low or too high, lights when battery level is normal & goes out when battery is charging.

The starter motor itself is driven by the original MGB starter signal via the starter relay. This has not changed.
