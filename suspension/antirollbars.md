## Anti-Roll Bars

I have an uprated 3/4" front anti-roll bar and a standard rear anti-roll bar with home made poly bushes on a car that's lowered approx 1" all round. For me, this gives the ideal driving experience on the road. Whether or not it makes it ''actually'' handle better is a moot point because I'm not racing the car so I don't care. I only care for how it feels driving it day to day. 

The Internet tells you that you don't need the rear anti roll bar if you've lowered the car. However I'd urge you to try for yourself rather than taking that as fact. In my case, fitting the rear ARB made the car feel MUCH better to drive on the road. It eliminated the vagueness of the rear end, it stopped the rear end from squirming around. This, together with an uprated front anti-roll, makes the car feel complete, together and thoroughly more "modern".

Of course, my engine location, weight, suspension and brakes are no doubt different to yours, so what works for me might not work for you.
