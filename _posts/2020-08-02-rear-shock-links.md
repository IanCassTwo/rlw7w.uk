title:  "Bad rear shock links!"
---

I went to visit a friend today and noticed some real nasty knocking at the rear of my car on the way home. It felt so bad that it was like the back of my car falling off! I pulled over and took a look and couldn't believe what I saw. One of my **brand new** shock links had separated from its bush! Luckily I was able to pull it back on at the side of the road. If it does it again, I'm going to have to work out something more permanent. What a bad design they are!
