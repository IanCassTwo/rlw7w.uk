I got refunded for the carpet that I ordered. Other vendors, whilst probably much more reliable and undoubtedly better quality were double the price, so I decided I'd stop being lazy and make my own using some rolled carpet that I bought from a friend. I spent a few days to complete and I'm proud of what I achieved. The end result is something that looks like it should be there. Perhaps it's not stunningly good quality but also it doesn't look at all out of place, which is mission accomplished. I've also re-taxed the car now that the weather is better so I'm enjoying driving it again. I've still got some more interior and exterior trim to complete, but it's mostly done ready for what remains of 2021 show season.
