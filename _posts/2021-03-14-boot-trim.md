title:  "Boot Trim"
---
This weekends job was to tidy up the trim in the boot area so it doesn't look quite so bad and to improve noise insulation. It was made from some 5mm hardboard and some aluminium angled strips that I had laying around the workshop. I covered it in the same carpet that I've used for the rest of the car. It's had a noticable positive effect on noise which can only get better once I add some more noise insulation to the underside.
