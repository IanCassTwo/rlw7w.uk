title:  "MGB RV8 Axle"
---
I scored a bargain on Ebay recently - an MG RV8 axle. For those in the know, this is quite a rare and usually expensive beast. It was used on a 1992-1995 MG RV8 which was based on an MGB. It's a Salisbury 12HA axle with a 3.3 ratio and an OEM Quaife torque sensing limited slip differential (LSD). I'm pretty sure it's going to fit the MGB but it's very different from the MGB axle so it's not a direct swap. The final drive ratio should be much better for my car and I'm excited to fit this but there are several hurdles to overcome first. [Read more here](/engineswap/axle/)
