title:  "Holland Sports Car Show"
---
I went to a car show yesterday and it's the biggest I've been to for the last 2 years thanks to Covid. There was a nice balanced mix of interesting classic cars there and future classics including a very rare MG XPower SV! The weather was great and there was a nice relaxed friendly atmosphere with a bar and bbq. My MG got quite a bit of interest from people gathering around trying to work out what the engine swap was from. I got some positive comments too which was nice. On the whole, a very enjoyable evening.
