title:  "Drive-It Day"
---
I drove to Hastings today with my local MG car club. This was to support [Drive-It day in aid of Childline](https://www.driveitday.co.uk/). We took the scenic route along A & B roads, no motorway. In total, over 4 hours of driving and 150+ miles. It was an immense amount of fun.
