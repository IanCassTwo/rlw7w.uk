Refitting is taking a little longer than I'd hoped. I'm taking my time to make sure that everything goes together perfectly and I don't have any mishaps with the new paint. I also need to get some trim that's missing, for example the front part of the roof gutter trim, half of the front windscreen seal locking trim and some badge grommets. I also, apparently, have some carpet in the post but it's not arriving. The vendor is very bad at communicating but hopefully it will turn up some time soon.
