title:  "Repaired the dashboard crash bar"
---
My dashboard crash bar was in a bad way. The "padding" inside had crumbled and broken. The vinyl was old and worn. It was obvious it needed attention and I was sure that it could be fixed quite easily. However, after taking it apart, it was obvious that it would need completely rebuilding. [Read all about how I did this](/interior/crashpad.html).
