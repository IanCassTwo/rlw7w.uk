title:  "Sunroof is patched for now"
---
My car came with a metal slide sunroof that took about 2" of headroom. This means that I couldn't physically fit in the car without hitting my head so I cut it out. I obviously couldn't drive around with a giant hole in the roof and I'm not ready to replace the roof yet so I did the only thing I could do any put a temporary patch in place. It was just a sheet of steel Sikaflexed and pop-rivetted to the roof with a bit of paint on it to prevent it immediately rusting. It doesn't look bad but it'll only be there until the winter.
