title:  "Headlining in place"
---
I took the opportunity to deal with the headlining before the new roof was fitted to the car. I've used 6mm self-adhesive closed call foam covered with 2mm foam backed headlining material stuck on with contact adhesive. It does look very nice and I'm sure it will look even better once the roof is on the car!
