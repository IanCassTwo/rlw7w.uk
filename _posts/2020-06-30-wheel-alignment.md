title:  "Ghetto wheel alignment"
---
I figured I needed to make some attempt to align the wheels before I drove it to the the MOT station, so I did the only thing I knew how & went old school with string & a tape measure. It seems I had some success because the car feels fine on the road. I'll get it aligned professionally once I can actually drive it somewhere to get it done
