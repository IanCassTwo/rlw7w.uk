title:  "Fuel pump baffle"
---
The MGB fuel tank is flat bottomed so I always had a problem with fuel starvation whenever I had anything less than half a tank of fuel so I decided to do something about it. I built a baffle to go around the fuel pickup. I can now drive the car without problem even when very low on fuel. [Find out more here](/engineswap/fueltank.html)
