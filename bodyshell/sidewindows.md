## Side Windows

The car had some corrosion at the bottom rear corner of the rear side windows. Apparently, this is a common area to rust. Both sides of the car were affected to a differing degree. The fix was the same for both sides - cut out the rusted area and make a patch to fit. It was quite complicated given its shape and general inaccessability for power tools. However, the end result should look ok especially considering it's covered by chrome trim.
