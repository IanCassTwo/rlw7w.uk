## Interior

The car was completely gutted when I got it. There was literally no interior at all installed in the car. I did get some of it seperately in boxes but there was a lot of it missing, damaged or just worn out. For example, I don't have any carpet or door cards and it didn't have any headlining. The seats were worn out and let's be honest, even brand new they would have looked horrible. Various other trim is going to need refinishing or rebuilding. However, it's not a large or complicated interior so I see this as an ideal opportunity to make it my own.
