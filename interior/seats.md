## Seats


The seats that arrived with my project were pretty much as you'd expect for a 40 year old car - faded, worn and in dire need of a rebuild, and at the end of the day, you have to agree, they are quite ugly. I located a pair of immaculate condition MX5 seats with speakers in the headrests for Â£50, so I've fitted these to the car instead.

They were relatively easy to fit. I used some 2" x 1" box section to raise the front of the seats. These contained some captive nuts & were welded to the floor to provide secure raised mountings for the front of the seat. The rear of the seats were simply bolted through the floor.
