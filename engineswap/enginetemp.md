## Engine Temperature

The coolant temperature output from the ECU (pin 11) works on the same principle as the MGB coolant temperature so the wire can be connected directly to the Smiths gauge. Once the engine is up to temperature, the gauge reads somewhat correctly but perhaps slightly on the low side. It's certainly working well enough to be useful.
