with better brakes and with better suspension. I wasn't too interested in restoring the car to factory spec. The obvious choice for an engine swap is the Rover v8. This engine is tried, trusted, proven and is very much the safe bet. It will fit, and there's hundreds of examples on the road today to prove that. However, it's very expensive and time consuming to gather all the right bits, especially if you want a more modern fuel injected variant. The gearbox options also mean that you need to replace the diff at even more expense. It's a relatively common choice for good reason, but I like to be different so [I considered other options][] The engine I settled on was an odd choice, one that no-one in the world had ever done before. I chose the 3.0 [GM 54° V6 X30XE][] from a UK Vauxhall Omega. It can be found in European Opel/Vauxhall Omega in rear wheel drive form or in Vectra, Cavalier and Calibra in front wheel drive form, and in the Saab 9000 as a turbo. It's also available in USA in the Opel Sintra, Cadillac Catera, CTS, Saturn L-series and Vue. It's a 200hp narrow angle V6 which suits our narrow engine bay. The engine is taller than most v6's but the profile of the inlet manifold is perfect for our bonnet shape. The 5 speed manual gearbox has ratios that are bearable on a standard MGB 3.9 rear axle although taller final drive is desirable. The starter motor is in the right place and a rear drop sump is available (from a front wheel drive variant). The ECU will run the engine standalone. It's also similar weight to the standard 4 cylinder but puts out 208bhp. It was cheap and available. This swap choice was not something I'd initially considered but my friend had one in his garage and he urged me to take a closer look, and the more I looked, the more like it seemed the perfect choice! It does of course have a few challenges but far fewer than any other engine I'd considered. I sold the original [engine][] and [gearbox][] to fund the project. ## Specifications The specifications of the engine is as follows:- |-------------------|--------------------------------------| | Capacity | 2962cc | | Configuration | 56° V6, 24-valve DOHC | | Max. power | 210PS (155kW) @ 6000rpm | | Max. torque | 270Nm (199.2 lb.ft.) @ 3400rpm | | Compression ratio | 10.8:1 | | Fuel Injection | Fully sequential | | Ignition | Distributorless 3 channel batch fire | | ECU | Bosch Motronic | ## Sump The first challenge was the large and bulbous front-drop sump that the engine came with as standard on the Omega. This, of course, was NOT going to work in the MGB. It would foul the cross member in every way possible. A rear-drop sump was required! Luckily the front wheel drive variants of this engine (Vectra, Cavalier or Calibra) come with a sump that's rear-drop when installed in a RWD configuration. So the first job to do on the engine is to remove the Omega sump and oil pickup pipe and install pickup and sump from a Vauxhall Vectra. When fitting the oil pickup pipe, make sure to use Loctite on the mounting bolts. You don't want this thing falling off! Make sure to be very careful about using the correct torque for the bolts too. When fitting the sump make sure to use the correct high temperature silicone sealant and a new sump gasket. Once again be meticulous about correct torque. Note, The sump bolts are really not done up very tight at all, so don't overtighten. <a class="lightbox-image" title="" href="/assets/images/resized/IMG_20190302_123315.jpg"> <picture> <source srcset="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123315-260-096a2de58.webp 1.0x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123315-390.0-096a2de58.webp 1.5x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123315-520-096a2de58.webp 2.0x" type="image/webp"> <source srcset="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123315-260-ed0c2f99e.jpg 1.0x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123315-390.0-ed0c2f99e.jpg 1.5x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123315-520-ed0c2f99e.jpg 2.0x" type="image/jpeg"> <source srcset="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123315-260-ed0c2f99e.jpg 1.0x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123315-390.0-ed0c2f99e.jpg 1.5x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123315-520-ed0c2f99e.jpg 2.0x" type="image/jpeg"> <img class="mediumthumb" style="max-width: 242px;" src="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123315-260-ed0c2f99e.jpg"> </picture> </a> <a class="lightbox-image" title="" href="/assets/images/resized/IMG_20190302_123323.jpg"> <picture> <source srcset="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123323-260-2fd637b72.webp 1.0x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123323-390.0-2fd637b72.webp 1.5x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123323-520-2fd637b72.webp 2.0x" type="image/webp"> <source srcset="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123323-260-4c1e2578c.jpg 1.0x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123323-390.0-4c1e2578c.jpg 1.5x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123323-520-4c1e2578c.jpg 2.0x" type="image/jpeg"> <source srcset="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123323-260-4c1e2578c.jpg 1.0x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123323-390.0-4c1e2578c.jpg 1.5x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123323-520-4c1e2578c.jpg 2.0x" type="image/jpeg"> <img class="mediumthumb" style="max-width: 242px;" src="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190302_123323-260-4c1e2578c.jpg"> </picture> </a> <a class="lightbox-image" title="" href="/assets/images/resized/IMG_20190316_180534.jpg"> <picture> <source srcset="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190316_180534-260-fa6166532.webp 1.0x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190316_180534-390.0-fa6166532.webp 1.5x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190316_180534-520-fa6166532.webp 2.0x" type="image/webp"> <source srcset="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190316_180534-260-a3dd917af.jpg 1.0x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190316_180534-390.0-a3dd917af.jpg 1.5x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190316_180534-520-a3dd917af.jpg 2.0x" type="image/jpeg"> <source srcset="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190316_180534-260-a3dd917af.jpg 1.0x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190316_180534-390.0-a3dd917af.jpg 1.5x, /assets/images/generated/IMG_20190316_180534-520-a3dd917af.jpg 2.0x" type="image/jpeg"> <img class="mediumthumb" style="max-width: 242px;" src="/assets/images/generated/IMG_20190316_180534-260-a3dd917af.jpg"> </picture> </a> {: .text-center } ## Coil Pack Mounting The DIS (Distributorless Ignition System aka coil pack) is bolted to the back of the engine on a metal bracket.

The standard Omega one is quite bulky and wants to occupy the same space as the steering cone on a right hand drive car. This pipe is essential for the running of the engine therefore needs to be re-made in a way that fits the MGB engine bay. I chose to make mine using very carefully cut and welded stainless steel tube.

However, I'm not convinced this is necessary. I suspect that the engine will fit without mods (with tight tolerances). I later made good this work and now it looks like the crossmember was never touched. IMG\_20190612\_210820.jpg IMG\_20190612\_210838.jpg IMG\_20190613\_182531.jpg IMG\_20190613\_182542.jpg i## Engine Mounts I went through several iterations of engine mount and came to the conclusion that it's not feasible to keep the standard location for MGB engine mount. It's occupying space that you need for the exhaust. Therefore, the mount needs to be slightly further forward. An engine mount always consists of 3 parts - the engine bracket, the rubber mount and the chassis bracket. The chassis bracket was moved to the rear part of the crossmember. There's plenty of room there to make a \~30 degree platform for the engine mount to bolt on to. The rubber mount is a generic engine mount that I purchase from [Car Builder Solutions][]. The engine side was templated in cardboard first and then cut from 5mm sheet steel, then carefully adjusted and trial-fitted until it was perfect. Remember to get both sides at exactly the same angle with engine aligned centrally.

The MGB gearbox mount was cut off, some holes drilled through the bottom and the Omega mount bolted on. I did later make a small adjustment to provide for a flat mounting surface but the amount of work here is trivial IMG\_20190407\_154652.jpg IMG\_20190407\_155706.jpg IMG\_20190417\_205222.jpg ## Transmission Tunnel The Omega gearbox is somewhat taller than the standard MGB box. I was concerned that it wouldn't fit so I performed a similar mod to what you'd do if you were fitting an LT88 or R380. I'm not 100% convinced this was necessary. I chose to do the mod slightly differently to how Rover did theirs. My method was less crude. I effectively reshaped the horizontal seam where the transmission tunnel meets the bulkhead & reattached it in exactly the same way but as a curved joint rather than a straight joint. I gained about 10-15mm of clearance & it still looks factory. IMG\_20190311\_203448.jpg IMG\_20190628\_191847.jpg IMG\_20190630\_200032.jpg [Car Builder Solutions]: https://www.carbuilder.com/uk/ ## Gearstick Location The gearstick, more by luck than judgement, is situated at almost exactly the right location. The gearstick mechanism bolts to the gearbox by 2 nuts & bolts. If you want it perfect, you need to make a small adjustment to one of the bolt holes to allow the mechanism to move by about 5mm to centre the gearstick. You should also completely remove the external reverse lockout mechanism. This is bulky and gets in the way. The gearbox has an internal lockout anyway so it's not required. The horrid gear knob appears to be bonded to the gearstick, so removed the Omega gearstick and made a new one from various size tubular bar stock. IMG\_20190508\_142652.jpg IMG\_20190508\_142703.jpg IMG\_20190510\_181744.jpg IMG\_20190511\_163103.jpg IMG\_20190916\_190004.jpg IMG\_20190916\_190014.jpg IMG\_20191020\_201412.jpg IMG\_20191020\_201420.jpg ## Alternator This by far took me the most time to resolve satisfactorily. The Omega alternator is mounted on the left hand side of the engine looking at it from the front (drivers side). It's situated below the drivers side cylinder head. It wants to be in the same location as the chassis rail so clearly it has to be relocated. I thought long and hard about where to put it :- - Low and to the side of the engine - absolutely no room. - High and to the side of the engine - there isn't really room to put it on the drivers side thanks to the brake booster. It could go on the passenger side but I couldn't identify any convenient mounting points to locate it here. - In front of the engine - There's loads of space here. So, if I had to mount it in front of the engine, how would I mount it & plan the belt routing? I figured there's no way I could mount it in front of the engine the correct way around. There's simply nothing to bolt it to. However, I did find 3 bolt holes behind the cambelt cover that were used for engine mounts when the car was in front wheel drive orientation. This gave me the idea that I could create a bracket to reverse mount the alternator. I went through several bracket shapes & lots of consideration for belt path so I could get optimal wrap around all pulleys and still maintain tension. I then went to the breakers yard and found a small, powerful alternator with the correct bracket position and the correct pulley. The one I found was off a Ford. I didn't realise it at the time but it was a "smart" alternator that can vary its output according to the ECU but without the ECU, it runs as a 1-wire alternator outputting 90 amps.

These are designed to fit onto an apparatus known as a "[multiram][]". This, in association with the inlet plenum, is part of the [variable length tuned intake system][] designed to enhance torque output. It's described in detail in the [Vauxhall College manual][]. The problem is, the entire Omega Multiram is physically too large to fit and also is designed to fit a drivers side mounted air filter. I don't have room for that in the MGB so an alternative inlet is necessary. I considered omitting the Multiram completely but this didn't necessarily solve any problems. I still needed to use the Omega rubber elbows that fitted onto the twin throttle bodies. Quite simply, I couldn't replace them with rubber tube because they were so close together and I couldn't locate any suitable tube that would fit. That left me with the situation that I needed to merge two 60mm pipes together into a single 80mm pipe so it could enter a common [air flow meter][]. I tried various different solutions but the one that fitted the best was made from 76mm PVC pipe and looked conceptually similar to the standard Opel Omega part. It also allowed me to retain the multiram valve mechanism. To complete the solution, I mounted an air filter behind the front grill and connected the two with flexible air ducting.

In a nutshell, it's allowing inert gas to dilute your incoming air meaning that you need more throttle opening to burn the same amount of fuel. This is good because it's reducing pumping losses in the engine. In normal circumstances, I suggest you [*don't* remove because it's saving you money][]! However in my case, I was making new tubular headers and I didn't want to incorporate the EGR system. Of course, it's not as simple as removing it because the ECU will helpfully tell you about it in the form of a check engine light, so we need to fool the ecu into thinking it's still there. Luckily this ECU is only measuring the return voltages of the EGR valve, so the answer is to build a circuit onto a piece of strip board that emulates this. You can use a pcb mount relay rather than an automotive relay to really reduce the size of the circuit. Once you've built the circuit, buy a small prototyping box from ebay to house it. ## SAI Delete Some ECUs use the o2 sensors to sniff the exhaust gases to make sure the [Secondary Air Injection (SAI)][] pump is running. However, this ECU is not that clever. This ECU is only measuring return voltage. The pump is hidden behind an automotive relay so the only thing the ECU can see is the coil in the relay. You can easily fool the ECU by bridging the SAI connector with a 100-200 Ohm resistor. It's not too critical what value you use provided it adds a little resistance.

The purpose of this is to [vent fuel vapour from the charcoal canister into the inlet manifold][]. In general, this is a good thing. However my UK model MGB never came with a charcoal canister. We vent our fuel tank to the atmosphere. Perhaps at some point, I'll install a complete closed loop vapour emissions system, but for now, I want to bypass this function. Once again, the ECU just wants to see some evidence that a relay has fired, so the same trick will work here as for the SAI. Bridge the purge valve connector with a 100-200 Ohm resistor. ## Fuel Pump Priming This ECU is peculiar in that it does not want to turn on the fuel pump until it see's a crank signal. That means the engine cranks for just a little longer than I'd like. I'd much prefer the pump to prime the fuel rail before I crank. The fix is to install a momentary relay to give the fuel pump power when you turn ignition on. Believe it or not, such a relay is harder to find than you might think. However, [Car Builder Solutions sell a 0-60 second timer relay][] which will engage for a short time when it's given power. This means we can use it to supply power to the fuel pump for 3-5 seconds when we first turn on the ignition. The fuel rail will then have fuel pressure so the engine fires quickly, then the ECU will turn the fuel pump on to maintain pressure. ## OBD Diagnostics Whilst the Omega does have what appears to be an OBD2 port, the Bosch Motronic M2.8.1 does not use OBD2 protocol. It uses a previous generation of protocol that was manufacturer specific. In this case, it uses KW82 protocol at 9600 baud which was an Opel improvement to [Bosch's original KW71 protocol][]. I've not been able to find any specifications on this other than it's a keyword protocol using ISO-9141 electrical interface on pin 7 (K-line) and does not use pin 15 (L-line). Other ECUs in the car (e.g. immobiliser) are available on other pins. Anyway, you're going to need a Vauxhall/Opel tool to communicate with the ECU. The official tools are VERY expensive and out of reach of the home mechanic, but if you google for OPCOM or VauxCom, you'll find lots of cheap Chinese knockoff interfaces. The quality of these varies, and they are all hassle to get working, but once you've got over the complicated setup, they work quite well. ## See Also - [Fuel Tank][] - [Propshaft][] - [Wiring][] [vent fuel vapour from the charcoal canister into the inlet manifold]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboard_refueling_vapor_recovery [Car Builder Solutions sell a 0-60 second timer relay]: https://www.carbuilder.com/uk/0-to-60-second-time-delay-relay-for-demist [Bosch's original KW71 protocol]: http://www.cardiagnostics.be/-now/GT1-MODIC-DIS_bestanden/Prescription%20Protocol%20KW-71.htm [Fuel Tank]: Fuel_Tank "wikilink" [Propshaft]: Propshaft "wikilink" [Wiring]: Wiring "wikilink" </div> <hr> <footer> <p><a href="#top" id="back-to-top">Back to top</a></p> <p class="text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0">Copyright &copy; 2020-2022 Ian Cass</p> <div class="d-flex mt-2"> </div> <script type="module" src="/assets/js/instantpage.js?1660215284" defer></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/just-the-docs.min.js?1660215284"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/vendor/lunr.min.js?1660215284"></script> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/lightbox.css?1660215284"> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/lightbox.min.js?1660215284"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/minimal-analytics-4-min.js?1660215284"></script> </footer> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
