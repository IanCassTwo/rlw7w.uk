## Propshaft

As you would imagine with an engine swap, the standard MGB propshaft will no longer fit, and even if it did wouldn't last long with the extra power. A brand new custom propshaft was made by [Dave Mac Propshafts Ltd][] in Coventry, UK. They are one of the best places to get a custom prop manufactured in UK, and they were also one of the few places who could supply a prop with the correct flanges to bolt direct to the gearbox without an adapter.

The complete specifications for the prop are shown below...

-   1 piece propshaft with 3 bolt gearbox flange, appropriate slider, 4
    bolt rear flange with 1140 face, with 1310 UJ's. It will need to
    take \~220bhp/200lbft torque on a 1000kg car.
-   Front flange
    -   96mm PCD 3 bolt gearbox output flange
    -   12mm bolt diameter
    -   16mm centre spigot diameter
-   Rear flange
    -   87mm diameter 4 bolt flange (it's an 1140)
    -   5/16" bolt size
-   Total length from flange to flange is 1084mm with axle at normal
    ride height

The longer length of the prop had me a little worried that the it would hit the strengthening section what bridges the transmission tunnel towards the rear of the car. However, it *just* misses when the axle is at full droop.

The extra length, however, did provide some frustration when fitting.  It's simply too long to fit after the engine & gearbox is in place!

*Note, even though the MGB diff has a flange for an 1140 UJ, Dave Mac Props used a special variant of the 1310 UJ on my prop which benefits from the larger physical size of the 1310 but will bolt to a smaller 1140 flange*
