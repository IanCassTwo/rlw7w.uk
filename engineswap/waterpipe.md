## Rear Water Pipe

This engine takes water from the radiator lower pipe and feeds it into
the back of the engine via a stainless steel pipe. The standard Omega
one is quite bulky and wants to occupy the same space as the steering
cone on a right hand drive car. This pipe is essential for the running
of the engine therefore needs to be re-made in a way that fits the MGB
engine bay. I chose to make mine using very carefully cut and welded
stainless steel tube. It needs to pass underneath the exhaust headers so
can't realistically be made of anything that will burn or melt.
