## Coil Pack Mounting

The DIS (Distributorless Ignition System aka coil pack) is bolted to the
back of the engine on a metal bracket. You'll need to relocate the DIS
unit because there's just no space for it there but you also need keep
the bracket because it doubles up as a lifting eye. This means you'll
need to use your angle grinder to cut off the shelf that the coil pack
sits on.
