## Gearbox Mount

The MGB gearbox mount is, amazingly, in more or less the right place for the Omega gearbox. The MGB gearbox mount was cut off, some holes drilled through the bottom and the Omega mount bolted on. I did later make a small adjustment to provide for a flat mounting surface on the inner face but the amount of work here is trivial
