## Front Crossmember

I had initially cut out a relief in the front suspension crossmember to provide clearance for the engine lower pulley. However, I'm not convinced this is necessary. I suspect that the engine will fit without mods (with tight tolerances). I later made good this work and now it looks like the crossmember was never touched.
