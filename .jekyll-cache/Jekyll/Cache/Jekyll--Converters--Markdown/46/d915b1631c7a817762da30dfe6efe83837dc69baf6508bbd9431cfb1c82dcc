I"ö<p>I took the opportunity to deal with the headlining before the new roof was fitted to the car. Iâ€™ve used 6mm self-adhesive closed call foam covered with 2mm foam backed headlining material stuck on with contact adhesive. It does look very nice and Iâ€™m sure it will look even better once the roof is on the car!</p>
