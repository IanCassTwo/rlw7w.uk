I"»<p>Refitting is taking a little longer than Iâ€™d hoped. Iâ€™m taking my time to make sure that everything goes together perfectly and I donâ€™t have any mishaps with the new paint. I also need to get some trim thatâ€™s missing, for example the front part of the roof gutter trim, half of the front windscreen seal locking trim and some badge grommets. I also, apparently, have some carpet in the post but itâ€™s not arriving. The vendor is very bad at communicating but hopefully it will turn up some time soon.</p>
