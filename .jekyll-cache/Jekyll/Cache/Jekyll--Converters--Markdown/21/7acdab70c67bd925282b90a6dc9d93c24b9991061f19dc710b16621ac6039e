I"n<p>I could never understand quite why my brakes weren’t as good as I thought they should be. I mean, I’d upgraded them with big calipers and v8 discs. They should work REALLY well. I began to suspect that perhaps the brake servo wasn’t giving as much assistance as it should so I decided to do a vacuum test on it. Turns out it’s not holding a vacuum and needs replacing. <a href="/brakes/brakeservo.html">Find out more here</a></p>
