<p>The car was completely gutted when I got it. There was literally no interior at all installed in the car. I did get some of it seperately in boxes but there was a lot of it missing, damaged or just worn out. For example, I donâ€™t have any carpet or door cards and it didnâ€™t have any headlining. The seats were worn out and letâ€™s be honest, even brand new they would have looked horrible. Various other trim is going to need refinishing or rebuilding. However, itâ€™s not a large or complicated interior so I see this as an ideal opportunity to make it my own.</p>
