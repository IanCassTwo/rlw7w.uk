I"Ê	<p>Iâ€™ve been slowly working through the jobs. The new side chrome strips are installed and itâ€™s immediately obvious that I need to tweak the door alignment but that can wait until the summer. The drivers and passenger door mechanisms are installed. Iâ€™ve also installed some <a href="/wiring/centrallocking.html">central locking solenoids</a> so that both door locks will operate from the alarm keyfob or from the drivers door if opened manually. I did post about this on an MGB forum but it turned into a rather nasty debate on whether you should even lock your MGB so I ended up deleting the thread. Seems they didnâ€™t mind me swapping the engine for a v6, changing from rubber to chrome bumpers, but daring to install central locking solenoids is a definite no-no!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also frustrated by an online seller whoâ€™s not delivering the carpet that I ordered a month ago. I donâ€™t mind being patient but heâ€™s giving me almost no comms to let me know whatâ€™s happening, and the few responses I did get from him were lies (â€œitâ€™s in the postâ€ and â€œIâ€™ll refund youâ€). Itâ€™s escalated into a Paypal dispute so hopefully Iâ€™ll get that refunded soon and ordered from elsewhere. I have, however, rebuilt most of the interior trim panels with new hardboard where necessary and new foam backed vinyl so theyâ€™re now looking rather nice. Once the carpet is in place, thereâ€™s only some missing chrome trim before itâ€™s ready for 2021 show season (assuming itâ€™s not cancelled again this year!)</p>
