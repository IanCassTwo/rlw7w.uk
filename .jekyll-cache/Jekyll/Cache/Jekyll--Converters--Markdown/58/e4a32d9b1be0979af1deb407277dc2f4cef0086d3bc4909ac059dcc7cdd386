<p>I wouldnâ€™t normally consider buying a project in this state but the condition of the body shell was what sold it to me. The shell was solid.  The inner and outer sills, castle rails and floor pan had all been replaced or had survived amazingly well from new (it had been Zeibarted at some point). The wings, scuttle and door panels had been replaced with genuine Heritage parts. The inner and outer wheel arches were rot free. The only parts of the shell that needed more than cosmetic attention were the lower rear of the rear side windows, the front of the chassis rails, and the sunroof. In the grand scheme of things, these items were trivial.</p>
