I"±<p>When I first had my car MOTed after the rebuild, I had problems with the rear drum brakes. I ended up replacing my new drums, shoes and cylinders with yet another new set to solve the problem. I learnt to hate drum brakes and resolved to swap to disc brakes as soon as was practical. I know this isnâ€™t going to make the braking any better but it should reduce maintainence effort and I enjoyed doing it as a project. <a href="/brakes/reardiscs/">Read more here</a></p>
