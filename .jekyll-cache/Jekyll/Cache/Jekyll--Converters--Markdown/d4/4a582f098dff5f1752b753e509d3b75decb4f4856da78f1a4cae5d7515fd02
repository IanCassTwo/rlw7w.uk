<p>There’s 2 high amperage wires that connect the alternator output to the starter motor. I’ve unwrapped these wires from the main engine bay loom and re-routed them from starter motor through the bulkhead to the area beneath the dashboard on the drivers side. I’ve mounted a new fuse box here and I’m using these to feed 2 permanent live circuits. These circuits are used for the engine ECU and fuel pump circuits.</p>

<p>The new alternator wire is a heavy gauge wire that goes directly from the alternator to the starter motor.</p>

<p>The alternator that I’ve fitted is a 1-wire unit which means that the charge light does not work anymore. I’ve replaced it with an <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/12V-Universal-fit-RED-LED-Alternator-Battery-Warning-Light-Charge-status-monitor/323749517837">intelligent red LED light</a> that flashes when battery level is too low or too high, lights when battery level is normal &amp; goes out when battery is charging.</p>

<p>The starter motor itself is driven by the original MGB starter signal via the starter relay. This has not changed.</p>
