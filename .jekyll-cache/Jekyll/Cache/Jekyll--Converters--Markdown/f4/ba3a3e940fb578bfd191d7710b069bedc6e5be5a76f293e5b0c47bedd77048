I"¼<p>I got refunded for the carpet that I ordered. Other vendors, whilst probably much more reliable and undoubtedly better quality were double the price, so I decided Iâ€™d stop being lazy and make my own using some rolled carpet that I bought from a friend. I spent a few days to complete and Iâ€™m proud of what I achieved. The end result is something that looks like it should be there. Perhaps itâ€™s not stunningly good quality but also it doesnâ€™t look at all out of place, which is mission accomplished. Iâ€™ve also re-taxed the car now that the weather is better so Iâ€™m enjoying driving it again. Iâ€™ve still got some more interior and exterior trim to complete, but itâ€™s mostly done ready for what remains of 2021 show season.</p>
