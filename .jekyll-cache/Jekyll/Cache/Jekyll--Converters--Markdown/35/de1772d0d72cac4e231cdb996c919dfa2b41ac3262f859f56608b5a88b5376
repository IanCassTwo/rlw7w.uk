<p>All the flat interior trim panels have been stripped down to their component parts. All vinyl and foam padding has been replaced with new. The backing hardboard has also been replaced with new where itâ€™s broken or perished.</p>

<p>This job was time consuming but relatively easy. The foam and vinyl was stuck down with contact adhesive and then stapled from the back in a similar way to the original.</p>
