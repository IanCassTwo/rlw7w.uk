<p>My front opening quarter window glass was literally falling out on both sides of the car. The substance that had been used to fit the glass had gone rock hard and was no longer holding the glass in place. So I scraped out the old sealant and replaced it with new <a href="https://gbr.sika.com/dms/getdocument.get/7eb1cb29-8d84-441c-9eea-d3486a539e31/sikaflex_-212_fc.pdf">Sikaflex 212</a>. This stuff is really messy to work with but does produce good results in the end. Luckily, I didnâ€™t have to use it very much.</p>
