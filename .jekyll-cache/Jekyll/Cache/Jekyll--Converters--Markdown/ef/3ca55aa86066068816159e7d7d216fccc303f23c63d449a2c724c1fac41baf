I"ý<h2 id="fog-light">Fog Light</h2>

<p>A 1980 model car needs to have a foglight and will fail an MOT if itâ€™s not present &amp; working. The standard car had a pair of fog lights dangling below the rear bumper. I donâ€™t particularly like them and wasnâ€™t keen on fitting, so I did something different. I figured the reversing lights werenâ€™t particularly good for lighting up the road behind so I sacrificed one of them to convert to a fog light.</p>

<p>The conversion was quite simple. I pulled out the reflector, drilled a hole in the back of the light unit &amp; mounted an ultra-bright LED. These are marketed on eBay as <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/4X-Eagle-Eye-Led-High-Power-12v-Car-Motor-Drl-Daytime-Running-Red-Lights-Back-Up/153713364337">Eagle Eye LED High Power 10w</a>. Theyâ€™re quite cheap. I got 4 for ~Â£5.</p>
