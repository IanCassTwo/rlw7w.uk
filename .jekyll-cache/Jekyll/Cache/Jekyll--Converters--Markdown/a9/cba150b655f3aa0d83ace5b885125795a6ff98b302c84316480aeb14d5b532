<p>The soft crash bar that runs along the top of the dashboard had perished in my car. You could easily see and feel that the internal padding had broken down &amp; was floating around. These parts are quite expensive to buy new so I thought it would be an easy job simply dismantle it and repair it. However, in reality I ended up completely rebuilding it because it was far beyond saving. Once dismantled, it was clear that the padding had completely perished and the plywood backing was rotten.</p>

<p>So the first job was to make a new plywood backing piece. I made this from 2 sections of 3mm ply cut to shape and glued together whilst clamped to the dashboard until it was cured. The reason I did it this way is because the backing piece is curved in 2 dimensions &amp; this is how you permanently set the shape that you need. Once this was done, I simply used the original part as a template to drill the holes and then moved over the original bolt fittings.</p>

<p>The padding material was made of some kind of compacted fibre material which had broken into a dozen small pieces and in some areas completely disintegrated. There was no way of gluing it back together so an alternative needed to be made. I thought long and hard about what I could use in its place and in the end settled on some <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Half-Round-Sponge-D-Rubber-Extrusion-25mm-x-12-5mm-Cars-Boats-Home-DIY/113726337398">half-round sponge rubber extrusion</a> that I bought from ebay combined with some left-over 6mm closed cell foam. This was glued together using contact adhesive and bound with sticky tape whilst it cured. I then covered the entire thing with the same <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Bentley-Plain-Soft-FR-Vinyl-Smooth-Grain-Vehicle-Faux-Leather-Upholstery-Fabric/362618616938">black leather effect vinyl</a> that I used on the roof frame. This wasnâ€™t glued on but just stretched over and stapled from behind. Once this was fitted, the finishing touch was some <a href="https://www.woolies-trim.co.uk/product/1117/vinyl-interior-piping">black interior vinyl piping from Woolies</a>.</p>

<p>The shape is a little different to the original but it would look good enough for me. This will not ever be a concurs car.</p>
