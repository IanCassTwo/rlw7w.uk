I"Ç<h2 id="propshaft">Propshaft</h2>

<p>As you would imagine with an engine swap, the standard MGB propshaft will no longer fit, and even if it did wouldn‚Äôt last long with the extra power. A brand new custom propshaft was made by <a href="https://davemacprops.co.uk/">Dave Mac Propshafts Ltd</a> in Coventry, UK. They are one of the best places to get a custom prop manufactured in UK, and they were also one of the few places who could supply a prop with the correct flanges to bolt direct to the gearbox without an adapter.</p>

<p>The complete specifications for the prop are shown below‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 piece propshaft with 3 bolt gearbox flange, appropriate slider, 4
bolt rear flange with 1140 face, with 1310 UJ‚Äôs. It will need to
take ~220bhp/200lbft torque on a 1000kg car.</li>
  <li>Front flange
    <ul>
      <li>96mm PCD 3 bolt gearbox output flange</li>
      <li>12mm bolt diameter</li>
      <li>16mm centre spigot diameter</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rear flange
    <ul>
      <li>87mm diameter 4 bolt flange (it‚Äôs an 1140)</li>
      <li>5/16‚Äù bolt size</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Total length from flange to flange is 1084mm with axle at normal
ride height</li>
</ul>

<p>The longer length of the prop had me a little worried that the it would hit the strengthening section what bridges the transmission tunnel towards the rear of the car. However, it <em>just</em> misses when the axle is at full droop.</p>

<p>The extra length, however, did provide some frustration when fitting.  It‚Äôs simply too long to fit after the engine &amp; gearbox is in place!</p>

<p><em>Note, even though the MGB diff has a flange for an 1140 UJ, Dave Mac Props used a special variant of the 1310 UJ on my prop which benefits from the larger physical size of the 1310 but will bolt to a smaller 1140 flange</em></p>
