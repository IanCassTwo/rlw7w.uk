<p>The obvious choice for an engine swap is the Rover v8. This engine is tried, trusted, proven and is very much the safe bet. It will fit, and thereâ€™s hundreds of examples on the road today to prove that. However, itâ€™s very expensive and time consuming to gather all the right bits, especially if you want a more modern fuel injected variant. The gearbox options also mean that you need to replace the diff at even more expense. Itâ€™s a relatively common choice for good reason, but I like to be different so I considered other options</p>

<p>The engine I chose is an odd choice at first glance and is one that no-one in the world had ever done before. I chose the 3.0 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_54%C2%B0_V6_engine#3.0">GM 54Â° V6 X30XE</a> from a UK Vauxhall Omega. It can be found in European Opel/Vauxhall Omega in rear wheel drive form or in Vectra, Cavalier and Calibra in front wheel drive form, and in the Saab 9000 as a turbo. Itâ€™s also available in USA in the Opel Sintra, Cadillac Catera, CTS, Saturn L-series and Vue. Itâ€™s a 200hp narrow angle V6 which suits our narrow engine bay. The engine is taller than most v6â€™s but the profile of the inlet manifold is perfect for our bonnet shape. The 5 speed manual gearbox has ratios that are bearable on a standard MGB 3.9 rear axle although taller final drive is desirable. The starter motor is in the right place, the clutch is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that can be driven by the MGB master and a rear drop sump is available (from a front wheel drive variant). The ECU will run the engine standalone with very easy wiring. Itâ€™s also similar weight to the standard 4 cylinder but puts out 208bhp.</p>

<p>This swap choice was not something Iâ€™d initially considered but my friend had one in his garage and he urged me to take a closer look, and the more I looked, the more like it seemed the perfect choice! It does of course have a few challenges but far fewer than any other engine Iâ€™d considered.</p>
