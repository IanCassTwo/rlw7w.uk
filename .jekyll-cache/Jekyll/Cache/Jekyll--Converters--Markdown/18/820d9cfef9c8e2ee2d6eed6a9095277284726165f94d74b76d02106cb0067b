<p>The X30XE as designed for the Omega comes with an inlet plenum with twin
throttle bodies. These are designed to fit onto an apparatus known as a
â€œ<a href="http://www.omegaowners.com/forum/index.php?topic=90513.0">multiram</a>â€. This, in association with the inlet plenum, is part of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_intake_manifold">variable length tuned intake system</a> designed to enhance torque
output. Itâ€™s described in detail in the <a href="http://calibra-classic.org/docs/vaux_v6_engine.pdf">Vauxhall College manual</a>. The
problem is, the entire Omega Multiram is physically too large to fit and
also is designed to fit a drivers side mounted air filter. I donâ€™t have
room for that in the MGB so an alternative inlet is necessary. I
considered omitting the Multiram completely but this didnâ€™t necessarily
solve any problems. I still needed to use the Omega rubber elbows that
fitted onto the twin throttle bodies. Quite simply, I couldnâ€™t replace
them with rubber tube because they were so close together and I couldnâ€™t
locate any suitable tube that would fit. That left me with the situation
that I needed to merge two 60mm pipes together into a single 80mm pipe
so it could enter a common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_flow_meter">air flow meter</a>. I tried various different
solutions but the one that fitted the best was made from 76mm PVC pipe
and looked conceptually similar to the standard Opel Omega part. It also
allowed me to retain the multiram valve mechanism. To complete the
solution, I mounted an air filter behind the front grill and connected
the two with flexible air ducting.</p>
