## Wheels

My MGB came with 5 14x5" alloy LE wheels. Four of them were in reasonable condition with oxidised alloy that was easily cleaned with wire wool, whilst the other had been lacquered and had corrosion under the lacquer.

Four of the wheels had tyres on them that were at least 20 years old. The date code on the tyres was showing either 1991 or 2001. The tyres had plenty of tread but were hard and cracked in places so the tyres were replaced with brand new 185/70/14 Avon ZT7 tyres. Note, when getting the wheels balanced, ask for "static balancing" or make sure that your tyre fitter is willing to be very careful where he places balance weights so it doesn't interfere with brake calipers or handbrake mechanism.
